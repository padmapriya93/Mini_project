# Mini_project
**Mini Project:** Health Sector Data Processing with Python, ETL, and SQL

**Project Overview:** This project involves creating a data pipeline that simulates real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Python and SQL. You will work with a sample health sector dataset, performing the following steps:

**Set Up Database Tables**
- Create necessary tables in a PostgreSQL database.
- Load raw data from CSV files into the database tables.

**Data Transformation**
- Perform data transformations using pandas, including filtering, joining tables, and aggregating data.
- Store the transformed data back into the database and export it as a new CSV file.
- Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis
- Extract the transformed data from the database.
- Generate basic statistical insights from the extracted data.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Database Setup**
  **Tools Required:** PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, or any other SQL management tool.
  
  **Tables to Create:**
  
  Patients: Patient ID, Name, Age, Gender, Address.
  
  Medical_Records: Record ID, Patient ID (Foreign Key), Diagnosis, Treatment, Date of Visit.
  
  Billing_Info: Bill ID, Patient ID (Foreign Key), Treatment Cost, Payment Status.
  
**Data Ingestion:**

  Load data from the provided CSV files into these tables using SQL COPY command or any other method.

**2. Data Transformation Using Python (pandas)**

**Filtering:**

Extract records for patients over 50 years of age.
**Joining:**

Combine data from Patients and Medical_Records to create a consolidated view of patient visits.

**Aggregation:**

Calculate the total cost of treatment for each patient from the Billing_Info table.

**Saving Transformed Data:**

   Load the transformed data back into a new table in the database called Patient_Summary.
   Save the transformed data as a CSV file.

**3. Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis**

  **Extract Data:**  
  Query the Patient_Summary table to retrieve the data.
  
  **Statistical Insights:**
  
  Generate basic statistics like the average treatment cost per patient, the number of visits per patient, and the percentage of unpaid bills.
  
  **Output:**
  
  Save the statistics as a report (e.g., a CSV or text file).
  
  **Sample Data (Health Sector):**
  
  You can create or download sample datasets for Patients, Medical_Records, and Billing_Info. Ensure that they contain diverse and realistic entries to cover various scenarios.

**Deliverables:**

  - SQL scripts for table creation and data loading.
    
  - Python scripts for data transformation and extraction.
    
  - CSV files containing the original data and the transformed results
    
  - A report containing the generated statistical insights.
    
**Assessment Criteria:**

  - Correctness of SQL queries and database table setup.
    
  - Effective use of pandas for data transformation.
    
  - Ability to integrate Python with SQL for ETL tasks.
    
  - Quality and accuracy of the generated statistical report.
    
  - Code quality, including proper documentation and readability.
    
This project will help trainees reinforce their understanding of Python, SQL, and ETL processes, giving them hands-on experience in data handling and analysis within a health sector context.
